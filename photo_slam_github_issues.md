### Description

My environment is Ubuntu20.04, gcc 11.4, CUDA 11.8, cuDNN 8.9.3, OpenCV with opencv_contrib and CUDA 4.8.0, libtorch cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.0.1+cu118.
My compilation passed, but when I ran it, the following error occurred. How can I solve it? I am running the rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_desk of TUM's rgbd dataset.

Same problem.

Just solved it! The problem is related to the your device with your firmware. Use older firmware, it works. It works for me with 05.13.05 version.

## Issue #48: view_result

**Status:** 🟢 Open  
**Author:** @XU0510  
**Created:** 2025-02-21 04:33:27 UTC  
**Updated:** 2025-02-21 04:33:27 UTC
**Comments:** 0  
**URL:** https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/48

### Description

I found the reason why the program wasn't running successfully. In the gaussian_mapper.cpp file under Photo-SLAM-main/src, there was an error in reading the input camera parameters. The parameter names were incorrect. Originally, it was written as camera.width_ = camera_file["Camera.w"].operator int();, and I changed it to camera.width_ = camera_file["Camera.width"].operator int(); std::cout << "Input camera image size: " << camera.width_ << std::endl; camera.height_ = camera_file["Camera.height"].operator int();. After making this change, the program runs normally. However, I still don't understand why the visualization interface is black and showing nothing.

I want to know what could cause my visualization to run with no results. How should I go about checking it?Could you provide a contact method for us to communicate, or you can email me at 1791133188@qq.com?

### Description

Hello, I successfully compiled and ran your algorithm. However, when I view the final experimental results, specifically the point_cloud.ply and input.ply files saved in the result directory, I noticed that the model is not colored in MeshLab. Could you please explain why this happens? Thank you very much for your open-source work, and I look forward to your reply.

## Issue #45: Understanding the coupling between 3DGS and ORB map

**Status:** 🟢 Open  
**Author:** @Lucasmogsan

### Description

Hi @liquorleaf @HuajianUP

First of all thanks for your impressive work!

I wonder if you could explain the reason for improved tracking as per your paper. As I can see on a high level in your code the front-end (ORB-SLAM) and back-end (ORB-SLAM + 3DGS mapping) is structured so the 3DGS implementation does not modify / improve on the ORB map directly?
If this is the case the 3DGS and SLAM is essentially quite decoupled and what would be the reasoning of using the 3DGS mapping within the SLAM pipeline?

What am I missing?

Thanks
Best
Lucas

## Issue #44: Photorealistic render issue

**Status:** 🔴 Closed

### Description

Hello, I'm trying to run Photo-slam on my device. 
I built the photo-slam on Jetson Orin board, then run the script for Replica RGB-D dataset.
Without `no_viewer` option, I can see the result of ORB-SLAM on the sub window. 
But, the rendering result seems incomplete. There are only several 3d Gaussian splatting images with magenta and green colors.
How can I run your algorithm? 
Is it enough to run the script code only? 
I could not find the pre-trained model weights. 
Thank you

## Issue #41: docker installation heartbroken

**Status:** 🔴 Closed  
**Author:** @JzHuai0108

### Description

Dear authors,

I tried to compile opencv with cuda and failed despite 20 hours of dogged trial as detailed [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/issues/3728).

So I turned to docker, and it failed me steadfast at the first step "docker pull hello-world".
Can you please give me a hint how to make it work?
I installed docker following the official [guidelines](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04).
Then I am stumped on the last step, docker pull hello-world.
It gives error "
Using default tag: latest
Error response from daemon: Get "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/": net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
"
I tried all approaches I found on stackoverflow 
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48056365/error-get-https-registry-1-docker-io-v2-net-http-request-canceled-while-b),
including adding DNS 8.8.8.8., and 8.8.4.4 to /etc/resolv.conf, no avail,
adding 
```{
	"auths": {},
	"proxies": {
		"default": {
			"httpProxy": "http://127.0.0.1:7890",
			"httpsProxy": "https://127.0.0.1:7890",
			"noProxy": "*.test.example.com,.example.org,127.0.0.0/8",
			"allProxy": "https://127.0.0.1:7890"
		}
	}
}
```
to ~/.docker/config.json, no avail
adding chinese servers hub.c.163.com to sudo nano /etc/default/docker, no avail.
logout "docker logout registry-1.docker.io", no avail.
Note every time I change these settings, I removed not working changes and restarted docker.

You just need to work harder.
Try the accepted approach from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23111631/cannot-download-docker-images-behind-a-proxy).

Actually when you get this point, there are dozens of pitfalls ahead waiting for you. I have gone through some of them in chronological order and show them one by one.
* build the photoslam code in docker and then commit to a new version image. see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44222376/docker-commit-on-a-existing-image)
```
docker stop distracted_sanderson 
docker commit distracted_sanderson photoslam:latest
# distracted_sanderson is the name of the docker container.
```
* within the docker, running replica_rgbd gets error "cuda driver version is insufficient for cuda runtime version in docker"
Also try nvidia-smi in the docker container. It is possible that cuda is not available in docker yet.
* But start docker with "--gpus all" or "--runtime=nvidia" options causes error: Error response from daemon: could not select device driver "" with capabilities: [[gpu]]]
We have to install nvidia container toolkit following instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75118992/docker-error-response-from-daemon-could-not-select-device-driver-with-capab).
* But at the penultimate step "sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker", ERRO[0000] unable to load config for runtime docker: EOF

## Issue #34: Interface modification

**Status:** 🟢 Open  
**Author:** @dongxiaozi  
**Created:** 2024-09-23 09:17:11 UTC  
**Updated:** 2025-03-19 06:10:37 UTC
**Comments:** 1  
**URL:** https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/34

### Description

Hello, I found that the main window of the interface does not seem to have the function of displaying 3D models. It either displays the rendered image of the current frame like the "current rendered frame" window, or displays the rendered image of the first frame. Is it possible to modify it to be similar to the main window of MonoGS: follow the camera's perspective to view the reconstruction of the current model in real time, so that you can know where more data needs to be collected during real-time reconstruction. Is it possible to implement this function? If so, can you provide some code modification ideas? Thank you.

Hello, have you solved this problem, or where can I obtain the final 3D model?

Might be a ORB-SLAM3 problem. Please see whether [ORB_SLAM3 issue 443](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3/issues/443) resolves it.

I've tried lots of solutions but all of them didn't work at all:(
After that I doubt that  the dataset is incomplete or broken so I download TUM dataset on their official website ,and I didn't encounter the same problem any more.
btw the dataset I used is dynamic scene,when I ran the code on static scenes it works fine.So u can try the solutions of ORB_SLAM3,and check your dataset.Hope it could help u :D

everything is the same as https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/2#issuecomment-2089933703
but the libtorch version is 2.4.0

then you must modify all of:
     c10::guts::to_string(param.unsafeGetTensorImpl());
to:
     param.unsafeGetTensorImpl();
which is mentioned in #5 

and you will see the visualization

## Issue #32: How can I build a yaml ？

**Status:** 🟢 Open  
**Author:** @Suhao07  
**Created:** 2024-09-06 18:32:12 UTC  
**Updated:** 2024-09-12 16:15:40 UTC
**Comments:** 6  
**URL:** https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/32

### Description

If I want to run on another dataset, how can I obtain the YAML file for Gaussian Mapper?

### Comments (6)

#### Comment #1 by @liquorleaf
*Posted on 2024-09-08 07:15:15 UTC*

You will need a YAML for ORB-SLAM3, e.g. cfg/ORB_SLAM3/Monocular/Replica/office0.yaml, and another YAML for Gaussian Mapper, e.g. cfg/gaussian_mapper/Monocular/Replica/office0.yaml.

Then you will have to adjust the parameters in both YAMLs:
For ORB-SLAM3,  adjust the parameters according to your type of sensor (there are also templates in cfg/ORB_SLAM3/Stereo and cfg.ORB_SLAM3/RGB-D) and image resolution.
For Gaus. Mapper, adjust the parameters started with Monocular./Stereo./RGBD. according to your type of sensor.

I mean how can I get a yaml for /cfg/gaussian_mapper on a  new dataset like tum_freiburg3_walking_xyz? When  I directly run it ,the error occurs:

This is probably not a YAML problem. Please see if #5 #12 #15 #33 solves it.

I tried these methods but it didn't work.Have you test it on  tum_freiburg3_walking_xyz before?When I tested on other datsets like tum_freiburg1_desk, I didn't encounter this issue.Or I mean  have you tested on dynamic scene before? Thanks for your reply:)

We haven't tested this sequence yet. Did you figure out where this exception was thrown with tools like VSCode cpp debugger? 
ORB-SLAM3 was not even able to initialize in your figure. If you were using RGBD, was there a proper association file (e.g. `cfg/ORB_SLAM3/RGB-D/TUM/associations/tum_freiburg3_long_office_household.txt`) for ORB-SLAM3?

Please see [ORB-SLAM3 association files for TUM](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3/tree/master/Examples/RGB-D/associations). Each sequence of TUM dataset needs a new association.txt.

### Description

Hello, thank you for your excellent work. I successfully compiled the Ubuntu 18.04 system according to the versions of other packages you provided, but there was a problem with the display interface during the final run. The current render frame and the overall field of view in the middle were flashing ellipses of various color or black screens, which did not display the correct results. However, there were no errors in the terminal. What is the reason for this situation? Is there any solution? Thank you.

1. Are the original 3DGS and SIBR_viewer working properly on your computer?
2. Are the image files rendered after shutdown correct?

If so, there may be some problem with the glfw-based ImGUI.

### Description

Hi, thank you for your great work! But I encountered some rendering problems. I am trying to use another visualization tool Rerun to do visualization research. I can display the SLAM frame image normally, but the current gaussian mapper frame image will show garbled colors. Do you have any ideas about it? Thanks!

A possible reason might be that glTexImage2D needs a 4-pixel alignment in width.
We padded the images with zeros before uploading to opengl. Please see the code related to `padded_sub_image_width_` and `padded_main_image_width_` in viewer/imgui_viewer.cpp.

### Description

I'm trying to test the tank and temples intermediate dataset with photo slam, but it doesn't seem to be rendering because it's not tracking.

I'm asking because I think my method may be wrong. Is photo slam a difficult model to operate on an outdoor dataset?

My results are below:

Photo-SLAM is a SLAM system but not a SfM system. It cannot track sequences which have no continuous motion between frames. In other words, it cannot track scenes which ORB-SLAM3 cannot track.

您需要给Gaussian Mapper模块持续提供两个输入：
1.来自SLAM重建得到的有色点云，用于提供3DGS稠密化的种子；
2.关键帧（包括图片、位姿两个要素），用于创建GaussianKeyframe并添加到GaussianScene。
具体而言，需要修改gaussian_mapper.cpp关于获取并格式化SLAM数据的部分，并调用相应函数进行添加。

You might need to modify the whole rendering module, since the rendering pipeline of NeRF (volume-based) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (point-based) is largely different.

Thank you for your reply. I have one more question.
If I need to freeze some Gaussians during training, how do you think I should modify the code?

---

#### Comment #3 by @liquorleaf
*Posted on 2024-09-10 08:27:41 UTC*

Properties of Gaussians are managed by SOAs during training. Please refer to `GaussianModel::densifyAndClone` and `GaussianModel::densifyAndSplit` to see how to make a `selected_pts_mask`, which indicates the points you want to optimize.

If the imgui viewer is available, just close the viewer and the results are automatically saved. Otherwise you might need to manually add some save points by changing `GaussianMapper::savePly` to a public member and calling it in the `while (!pSLAM->isShutDown())` main loop.

### Description

First of all, thank you for your excellent work ! I ran your SLAM program before. The result printed out a list of the number of keyframes used, which I found to be used many times. So I would like to ask, for the part of Gaussian mapping, whether to only render keyframes and compute the loss of the rendered keyframes image and the ground truth.  In this case, is the ground truth of non-keyframes wasted, and non-keyframe pictures are not actually rendered. what is the purpose and benefit of doing so?
I'm  curious about this, because I think it's an important part and I hope you can answer my question.Thanks!

Hi. Thanks for your interest. Yes, we perform mapping optimization among keyframes. The main reason is to reduce computational cost. Using all frames may increase the final rendering quality but it will take more time for optimization.

### Description

Congratulations for your amazing work.
I read in your paper that you have used a ZED 2 stereo camera to collect outdoor scenes.
But I couldn't find the code for ZED 2 in the repository, only for the RealSense.
Could the ZED code be available?
Many thanks!

Hi, we don't have live demos with ZED2. We used ZED SDK to collect frames and then run the experiments. You can refer to the EuRoC stereo example. If you want to access our stereo data, I can share it with you via cloud storage.

Dear Huajian,

I would appreciate it if you could share the stereo data via cloud storage.

Hi, great work!

How do you get the results of the Euroc dataset in Table 3.
The results are different from the original paper of ORBSLAM3 and DROID-SLAM.

Thanks.

## Issue #15: how to render the image from random viewpoint

### Description

I have successfully run your code; it’s a nice work. However, I have some issues when applying it and hope to get your help.
1. The final results only include the render image and camera outputs; the GS results are not found. If I want to input a random camera pose and render the image from that viewpoint, how should I proceed?
2. I have test on my own iphone camera data use monocular mode, but the result is not well, here is the results. The left image is input image and right image is rendered image. I used the Monocular/Replica/iffuce0.yaml gaussian_mapper parameters. Which parameters can I adjust to improve the results?

Hi, Thank you for your interest and testing our code.

1) The default path to store the PLY file is `SEQ_RESULTS/xxxxx_shutdown/ply/point_cloud/iteration_xxxxx/point_cloud.ply. You can use any viewers compatible with GS visualization to load the PLY file and check the results. Moreover, you can also refer to our evaluation code.

2) You should ensure the intrinsic model of the iPhone camera is calibrated. As an online system, it will stop optimization once tracking is finished. When we continue to visit new places, the newly added Keyframes and primitives have not been thoroughly optimized. A simple solution is to keep optimizing after processing all frames. In addition, you can adjust the densification parameters for fine-tuning. 

3) We rectify the input images to undistorted perspective images before photorealistic mapping. Currently, the code is not compatible with fisheye images yet, refer to [camera.h](https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/blob/f8bfb2f0809c003ccc3fd577dc43c576fcafa4ac/include/camera.h). To address this issue, you can add an OpenCV fisheye model there, [cv::fisheye::initUndistortRectifyMap](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/db/d58/group__calib3d__fisheye.html#ga0d37b45f780b32f63ed19c21aa9fd333). And we will update our code and support it later.

Thank you for your reply, I will calibrate my camera and then to test.
I want to use /bin/view_result to show the ply result, but error.
The run code is:
```
./bin/view_result ./cfg/gaussian_mapper/Monocular/Replica/replica_mono.yaml ./cfg/ORB_SLAM3/Monocular/Replica/office0.yaml ./results/replica_mono_0/office0/5481_shutdown/ply/point_cloud/iteration_5481/point_cloud.ply
```
The result is:
```

  what():  [Gaussian Mapper]Unsupported camera model: /home/zyw/data/repo_common/Photo-SLAM/cfg/ORB_SLAM3/Monocular/Replica/office0.yaml
```
The camera.type in office0.yaml is 'Pinhole', which is not 'Pinhole' in gaussian_mapper.cpp. So I change the office0.yaml  'PinHole' to 'Pinhole' and run again. But error again. Here is the log:

1) For evaluation, please refer to [Photo-SLAM-eval](https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM-eval)

2) Simply modifying the .yaml file won't work for fisheye images. We need to change the undistortion function in [camera.h](https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/blob/f8bfb2f0809c003ccc3fd577dc43c576fcafa4ac/include/camera.h) to support the KB camera model.

I found the reason why the program wasn't running successfully. In the gaussian_mapper.cpp file under Photo-SLAM-main/src, there was an error in reading the input camera parameters. The parameter names were incorrect. Originally, it was written as camera.width_ = camera_file["Camera.w"].operator int();, and I changed it to camera.width_ = camera_file["Camera.width"].operator int(); std::cout << "Input camera image size: " << camera.width_ << std::endl; camera.height_ = camera_file["Camera.height"].operator int();. After making this change, the program runs normally. However, I still don't understand why the visualization interface is black and showing nothing.

Hi Xiang,

If the example code is run on a local machine with a monitor rather than remote servers, you should be able to use the viewer without using the command "no_viewer".

Thank you so much about your kind reply! 
I've noticed this issue and I compile your code successfully in docker with the dockerfile provided by https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/2#issuecomment-2089933703.
However, when I try to run it, it seems another error occurred. So confusing it is that seems nobody have met this before. Could you please check for it and provide some suggestion?
Thanks a lot!

Thank you so much about your kind reply! 
I've noticed this issue and I compile your code successfully in docker with the dockerfile provided by https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/2#issuecomment-2089933703.
However, when I try to run it, it seems another error occurred. So confusing it is that seems nobody have met this before. Could you please check for it and provide some suggestion?
Thanks a lot!

*Posted on 2024-08-24 07:16:15 UTC *(edited: 2024-08-27 08:48:28 UTC)**

have same question, too

I changed release mode to debug mode in cmakelist and then realized that the problem seems to be here

```
[Current thread is 1 (Thread 0x7a29337fe000 (LWP 185084))]
(gdb) bt
#0 0x00007a29315edf92 in ??? () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/swrast_dri.so

    at /usr/include/c++/11/bits/invoke.h:96

```

in `imgui_viewer.cpp` remove line 485 such as
```
//--------------ImGui Rendering--------------
ImGui::Render();
// ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_RenderDrawData(ImGui::GetDrawData());

//--------------Draw main window SLAM--------------
// Set relative viewpoint
glPushMatrix();
```

The code can output the rebuild results normally, but it cannot display the build map in real time. Maybe there is a slight problem with this part


I found that
```
      GL_CALL(glDrawElementsBaseVertex(
          GL_TRIANGLES,
           (GLsizei)pcmd->ElemCount, 
           sizeof(ImDrawIdx) == 2 ? GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT : GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 
           (void*)(intptr_t)(pcmd->IdxOffset * sizeof(ImDrawIdx)), 
           (GLint)pcmd->VtxOffset)
           );
```
pcmd->IdxOffset and pcmd->VtxOffset both is 0，They may represent base addresses in memory

I noticed that the vtfofffset and idxoffset just don't seem to be quite right here.
```
    ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_SetupRenderState(draw_data, fb_width, fb_height, vertex_array_object);

    // Will project scissor/clipping rectangles into framebuffer space
    ImVec2 clip_off = draw_data->DisplayPos;         // (0,0) unless using multi-viewports
    ImVec2 clip_scale = draw_data->FramebufferScale; // (1,1) unless using retina display which are often (2,2)

    // Render command lists
    for (int n = 0; n < draw_data->CmdListsCount; n++)
    {
        const ImDrawList* cmd_list = draw_data->CmdLists[n];

  
       // std::cout<< draw_data->CmdLists[n]->CmdBuffer[0].VtxOffset<<std::endl; // 0
       // std::cout<< draw_data->CmdLists[n]->CmdBuffer[0].IdxOffset<<std::endl; // 0
       // std::cout<<"~~~~~~~"<<std::endl;
```

## Issue #11: Evaluation Issues

**Status:** 🔴 Closed  
**Author:** @DapengFeng  
**Created:** 2024-06-05 08:37:33 UTC  
**Updated:** 2024-06-16 08:47:30 UTC
**Comments:** 3  
**URL:** https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/11

### Description

Thanks for your great work! I still have some issues with the evaluation. Here's a more detailed look:
1. Are the reported PSNR, SSIM, and LIPIS values for all frames or just selected keyframes? The released code only renders and records the keyframes.
2. When calculating rendering metrics, the released code uses `undisort_mask` to disable invalid regions. What is the distinction between `undisort_mask` and `gt_depth_mask`, such as `gt_depth > 0`? How about using the original image without any mask for evaluation?

I really appreciate hearing from you.

1. When evaluating, we use another self-wirtten Python tool to render the reconstructed point cloud for all frames, not only Keyframes. However the tool is too naive and even ugly in programming so we didn't release it. You can ask @HuajianUP for more information about the code of our evaluation tool.
2. We undistort all gt images simply because our Gaussian Splatting backend cannot deal with distortion. It can only render undistorted views. So we use undistort all images for photorealistic evaluation. This is also a limitation of the original 3D Gaussian Splatting.
3. As for gt depth, we use thresholds to filter out extremely small or large depth just for accuracy consideration. This is common for industrial depth cameras such as the Intel Realsense D455.

I really appreciate your help. I've been studying different GS-SLAM repositories and noticed the various evaluation techniques used. Your method stands out with better qualitative results compared to others, even under similar PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS reported in the papers. So I would like to request the evaluation tool for fair comparison with others at a quantitative level. Thank you for your assistance! @HuajianUP

Hi, Dapeng. I have just made the evaluation code publicly accessible. Please refer to the updated README.md file for detailed information. I hope this code will be beneficial to you during the evaluation process.

However, I would like to note that the evaluation code has not been cleaned up and well-tested, especially for the Python environment. You are welcome to contribute.

## Issue #10: About the original gui of ORB-SLAM 

**Status:** 🔴 Closed  
**Author:** @Tianci-Wen

### Description

Hi, thanks for your excellent work!
I am trying to use your visualization tool to visualize 3D gaussians, and also want to use pangolin, the original visualization tool of ORB-SLAM3, to better observe the output of SLAM. 
I found that you almost completely commented out the visualization parts of pangolin and ORBSLAM3 in your code. 
I also tried it and found that **pangolin seems to be incompatible with cuda**. ​​In addition, **pangolin is also incompatible with the current opencv4.7**. 
I wonder if you have encountered similar problems, or can you share some reasons why you don't use the original visualization tool of ORB-SLAM3 pangolin?

We used to apply pangolin-0.6 at an early stage of development, but finally switched to ImGUI for its more powerful customization. We also did this for ImGUI is more portable and thus can be integrated into our project, while pangolin requires users to install extra library. We have implemented main part of the original viewer features (i.e. drawing MapPoints and Keyframe frustums) and considered the original viewer unnecessay.

Looks like the same problem with #2. Have you tried [this Docker](https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/2#issuecomment-2089933703)?

## Issue #8: About details of  Gaussian pyramid 

**Status:** 🔴 Closed  
**Author:** @lucky9-cyou  
**Created:** 2024-05-09 13:29:19 UTC  
**Updated:** 2024-06-03 06:32:02 UTC
**Comments:** 3  
**URL:** https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/8

### Description

Thanks for your wonderful code and paper.

I would like to ask some details about the Gaussian pyramid. As training progresses, it is mentioned in the paper that Gaussian smoothing and downsampling operations will be continuously used to obtain a lower Gaussian pyramid. I would like to ask, during this process, whether the previous Gaussian pyramid will continue to train and whether it will downsample the incoming pictures at the same time. And after training, how to perform inference using multiple Gaussian pyramids.

In our paper and implementation,  GausPyramid.do means each Keyframe is downsampled when used for the first few times [(GausPyramid.sub_level_times_of_use per level) * GausPyramid.num_sub_levels] after it enter GaussianMapper. The pyramid of each Keyframe is independent from that of one another. And each iteration only takes one Keyframe into account and consumes just one time of using. After all the GaussianPyramid using times exhausts, it will join the iteration who chooses it in primary resolution.

Thanks for your answer, I will check the code again.

Seems your whole Gamut is wrong? This scene should be mainly white but you got a pink result.

### Description

After building the project on Ubuntu 22.04LTS with the same versions of the dependencies as mentioned in README, I'm trying to run the examples/tum_mono.cpp with args:
```
"args": ["../ORB-SLAM3/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt", 
                     "../cfg/ORB_SLAM3/Monocular/TUM/tum_freiburg1_desk.yaml",
                     "../cfg/gaussian_mapper/Monocular/TUM/tum_mono.yaml",
                     "../data/TUM/rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_desk",
                     "../results/tum_mono_$i/rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_desk",
                     "no_viewer"],
```
but got error report bellow:

> [Gaussian Mapper]CUDA available! Training on GPU.

Exception occurred in function:
```
void ORBextractor::ComputePyramid(cv::Mat image)
    {
        for (int level = 0; level < nlevels; ++level)
        {
            float scale = mvInvScaleFactor[level];
            Size sz(cvRound((float)image.cols*scale), cvRound((float)image.rows*scale));
            Size wholeSize(sz.width + EDGE_THRESHOLD*2, sz.height + EDGE_THRESHOLD*2);
            Mat temp(wholeSize, image.type()), masktemp;
            mvImagePyramid[level] = temp(Rect(EDGE_THRESHOLD, EDGE_THRESHOLD, sz.width, sz.height));

            // Compute the resized image
            if( level != 0 )
            {
                resize(mvImagePyramid[level-1], mvImagePyramid[level], sz, 0, 0, INTER_LINEAR);

                copyMakeBorder(mvImagePyramid[level], temp, EDGE_THRESHOLD, EDGE_THRESHOLD, EDGE_THRESHOLD, EDGE_THRESHOLD,
                               BORDER_REFLECT_101+BORDER_ISOLATED);
            }
            else
            {
                copyMakeBorder(image, temp, EDGE_THRESHOLD, EDGE_THRESHOLD, EDGE_THRESHOLD, EDGE_THRESHOLD,
                               BORDER_REFLECT_101);
            }
        }

    }
```

When trying to call `cv::Mat` or `cv::resize()` with parameters including `Size` type, exceptions about assertion failure occurred.
For example, I replace
```
Mat temp(wholeSize, image.type()), masktemp;
```
with
```
Mat temp(sz.height + EDGE_THRESHOLD*2, sz.width + EDGE_THRESHOLD*2, image.type()), masktemp;
```
the exception disappeared when `level=0`, but this exception occurred when `level=1`:
>terminate called after throwing an instance of 'cv::Exception'
>  what():  OpenCV(4.8.0) /home/lrc/opencv/opencv-4.8.0/modules/imgproc/src/resize.cpp:4065: error: (-215:Assertion failed) inv_scale_x > 0 in function 'resize'

However, when I replace `main()` function with
```
int main()
{
    using namespace std;
    using namespace cv;
    string path = "./test.jpg";
    Mat images;
    vector<String> filename;
    glob(path, filename, false);
    size_t count = filename.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
    {
        images = imread(filename[i]);
        if (!images.data) {
            cout << "Image reading error !" << endl;
            continue;
        }
 
        Size dsize = Size(100, 70);
        Mat shrink;
        resize(images, shrink, dsize, 0, 0, INTER_AREA);
 
        stringstream str;
        str << "./test1.jpg";
        imwrite(str.str(), shrink);
    }
}
```
it run and resized an image successfully. So I think OpenCV environment has nothing to do with the problem.

**Then why the exception occurred?**

As far as I know, `(-215:Assertion failed) s >= 0 in function 'setSize'` happens when the `Mat` is empty, which is often caused by incorrect image path. Have you checked whether all the `cv::Mat` have proper content?

---

#### Comment #2 by @Eragonlrc
*Posted on 2024-04-20 07:23:24 UTC*

Thanks for replying! However, I insert 
```
imwrite("./image_level" + to_string(level) + ".jpg", image);
```
before 
```
Mat temp(wholeSize, image.type()), masktemp;
```
to check the content of `cv::Mat image` in function `ORBextractor::ComputePyramid()`
As a result, it saves a correct 640*480 gray image. So I'm sure that the function has a correct input.
And `wholeSize.width=678`, `wholeSize.height=518`

The problem confuses me most is that when I replaced the usage of `Size` variables, the exception dissappeared, while it's impossible to replace every usage of `Size` variables.

Solved by preparing the environment by docker.

> The problem confuses me most is that when I replaced the usage of `Size` variables, the exception dissappeared, while it's impossible to replace every usage of `Size` variables.

It may conflict with the built-in system `opencv` in `ORB-SLAM3`.

## Issue #5: An Error in imgui_viewer

**Status:** 🟢 Open

### Description

There is a problem when I run `./bin/tum_mono` or `./bin/gaussian_viewer`. The Error like this
```shell
Pass 'Combine redundant instructions' is not initialized.
Verify if there is a pass dependency cycle.
Required Passes:
Segmentation fault
```
Code related with this problem in `imgui_viewer.cpp` line 363
```cpp
glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
        // Draw main window image
        if (show_main_rendered_)
        {
            auto drawlist = ImGui::GetBackgroundDrawList();
            if (pSLAM_ && tracking_vision_)
            {
                drawlist->AddImage((void *)(intptr_t)rendered_img_texture, ImVec2(0, 0),
                                   ImVec2(glfw_window_width_, glfw_window_height_));
            }
            else
            {
                cv::Mat main_img = pGausMapper_->renderFromPose(
                    Tcw_main_, rendered_image_width_main_, rendered_image_height_main_, true);
                cv::Mat main_img_to_show = cv::Mat(rendered_image_height_main_, padded_main_image_width_, CV_32FC3, cv::Vec3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));
                main_img.copyTo(main_img_to_show(image_rect_main));
                glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, main_img_texture);
                glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, main_img_to_show.cols, main_img_to_show.rows,
                     0, GL_RGB, GL_FLOAT, (float*)main_img_to_show.data);
                drawlist->AddImage((void *)(intptr_t)main_img_texture, ImVec2(0, 0),
                                   ImVec2(glfw_window_width_, glfw_window_height_));
            }
        }

Hi!
Which version of CUDA and LibTorch did you use?
If you have integrated graphics along with independent graphics, have you tried setting the system to disable the integrated ones and use only the independent ones?

#### Comment #2 by @wangwang-xyz
*Posted on 2024-04-16 09:16:21 UTC*

The environment I used is：
* cuda 11.8
* LibTorch 2.0.1
* WSL2

It seems this problem caused by LibTorch which built with llvm.
I flowed this issue to update LibTorch to nightly version(2.4.0.dev20240415+cu118) and solved the problem
pytorch/pytorch#103756

In addition, LibTorch removed `c10::guts::to_string` in nightly version. Therefore, `gaussian_model.cpp` need to be modified.
Replace  all
```cpp
key = c10::guts::to_string(param.UnsafeGetTensorImpl());
```
 with 
```cpp
key = param.UnsafeGetTensorImpl();
```

Similar segmentation fault error solved thanks to this issue!
BYW in LibTorch nightly version (2.4.0.dev20240425+cu118) replace all
```
key = c10::guts::to_string(param.UnsafeGetTensorImpl());
```
with
```
key = param.unsafeGetTensorImpl();
```
which uses camel case.

#### Comment #4 by @alexjunholee
*Posted on 2024-06-03 06:29:40 UTC*

In my case, the error was showing the exact same error message.

it was just a segfault error like below:
``` 104 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) ```

However, changing to nightly build as recommended from @wangwang-xyz and @Eragonlrc solved the issue! Thanks! 

*Note that you need to remove the whole build folder when re-building with the new libtorch.

Thank you for your solution!
However,I met some trouble after I update LibTorch to nightly version.The error like this

It seems the opencv mismatch with the libtorch?I have no idea about this. Have you met this trouble?Could you please teach me how to solve it? Thank you!

Hi Jiyu,

I reproduced this error when using the latest version of LibTorch, regardless of the OpenCV version. We will investigate further and try to support the latest version of LibTorch in the future.

Please use the tested LibTorch version first and then you should be able to compile the code successfully.

everything is the same as https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/2#issuecomment-2089933703
but the libtorch version is 2.4.0

then you must modify all of:
     c10::guts::to_string(param.unsafeGetTensorImpl());
to:
     param.unsafeGetTensorImpl();
which is mentioned in #5 

and you will see the visualization

Seems like your linker cannot find the CURL symbols. Have you tried `sudo apt install curl libcurl4-openssl-dev`, or linking -lcurl manually?

Thanks for your reply. I did some try aboyt `sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev`,but not `sudo apt install curl libcurl4-openssl-dev`, your advice worked!  Problems Solved

### Description

My current problem is that the `glfwGetError` function cannot be found in `libimgui.so`. I guess my `glfw` version (3.3.2-1) is wrong. I would like to ask what is your `glfw `version?

#### Comment #1 by @Tianci-Wen
*Posted on 2024-04-11 12:49:31 UTC*

I fixed this issue after updating [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases) to 3.3.10. But I'm also not sure about the minimum glfw version requirements.
This version of glfw can be easily installed by following the commands:

```
wget https://codeload.github.com/glfw/glfw/tar.gz/refs/tags/3.3.10
cd glfw
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
sudo make install
```

Seems like your linker failed to find symbols of opencv, jsoncpp, ORB_SLAM3, etc. Have you tried a newer version of cmake? Did you change anything in CMakeLists.txt?

> Seems like your linker failed to find symbols of opencv, jsoncpp, ORB_SLAM3, etc. Have you tried a newer version of cmake? Did you change anything in CMakeLists.txt?

I update my cmake to 3.27.5, but it resport the same error that it failed to link opencv, ORB_SLAM3, etc. 

For the CMakeLists.txt, I just add `set(Torch_DIR /home/lzy/workingspace/Photo-SLAM/lib/libtorch/share/cmake/Torch)`. Now I'm trying to set path for these library.

For the build.sh, I modify `make -j8` to  make `-j128 `. I have tried with `make -j8`, same error.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # add OpenCV_DIR definitions if needed, example:
#cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOpenCV_DIR=/home/rapidlab/libs/opencv/lib/cmake/opencv4
make -j128

# Photo-SLAM
echo "Building Photo-SLAM ..."
cd ../..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. # add Torch_DIR and/or OpenCV_DIR definitions if needed, example:
#cmake .. -DTorch_DIR=/home/rapidlab/libs/libtorch/share/cmake/Torch -DOpenCV_DIR=/home/rapidlab/libs/opencv/lib/cmake/opencv4
make -j128
```

Here is my CMakeLists.txt:

I would like to ask if you can provide a docker container, so that there should be no problem with the environment.

Could you find the target symbols in the .so libs by command like ?
```
nm -C ./ORB-SLAM3/lib/libORB_SLAM3.so | grep "TrackMonocular"
```

It does seem to find this function in libORB_SLAM3.so :

What it want is `ORB_SLAM3::System::TrackMonocular(cv::Mat const&, double const&, std::vector<ORB_SLAM3::IMU::Point, std::allocator<ORB_SLAM3::IMU::Point> > const&, std::string)'`. In libORB_SLAM3.so, it is  
```
lzy@lzy:~/workingspace/Photo-SLAM$ nm -C ./ORB-SLAM3/lib/libORB_SLAM3.so | grep "ORB_SLAM3::System::TrackMonocular"
0000000000142bc0 T ORB_SLAM3::System::TrackMonocular(cv::Mat const&, double const&, std::vector<ORB_SLAM3::IMU::Point, std::allocator<ORB_SLAM3::IMU::Point> > const&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >).
```

They are different in the final input parameter `std::string` and `std::allocator<ORB_SLAM3::IMU::Point> > const&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >`.  

I'm wondering if there's something wrong with my gcc version.

After configuring the environment on docker, I successfully compiled and ran the replica data set. There may be some problems with the C++ environment of my computer.

Had an issue with the build.sh using the above dockerfile, but solved it.

Adding Torch_DIR to the last `cmake ..` call (as suggested in the comment) of the `build.sh` solved it for me! 
I did not add the `-DOpen_CV` variable, as I could not find the equivalent directory within the container.
- Changed to `cmake .. -DTorch_DIR=/libtorch/share/cmake/Torch` without  `-DOpen_CV`

你好，这个项目可以生成稠密点云和轨迹图吗？

同时，这个项目如何部署在真实世界中。并且在docker中没有图形化节面改怎么查看结果呢？

I had the same issue and ended up finding out that for me it was the wrong version of libtorch, mine was libtorch-shared-with-deps-2.0.1+cu118, which had to be replaced with libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.0.1+cu118 mentioned in this project.

ENV Torch_DIR /libtorch/share/cmake/Torch

RUN git clone https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM.git /Photo-SLAM

WORKDIR /Photo-SLAM

everything is the same as https://github.com/HuajianUP/Photo-SLAM/issues/2#issuecomment-2089933703
but the libtorch version is 2.4.0

then you must modify all of:
     c10::guts::to_string(param.unsafeGetTensorImpl());
to:
     param.unsafeGetTensorImpl();
which is mentioned in #5 

and you will see the visualization

## Issue #1: How can i run in ubuntn18.04LTS?

**Status:** 🔴 Closed  
**Author:** @chengYi-xun

### Description

when I run replica_mono test and when I run to

``` std::shared_ptr<GaussianMapper> pGausMapper = std::make_shared<GaussianMapper>(pSLAM, gaussian_cfg_path, output_dir, 0, device_type); ```
here, an error occurs.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc

At the same time, when I run to here:
```    
std::filesystem::path pathImageDir(strImageDir);
pathImageDir /= "results";
```
it also throws an error“段错误 (核心已转储)”. This seems to be an issue with `std::filesystem::path`, and I don't know how to resolve it.

Hi!
It looks like the default version of gcc/g++ provided in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS does not support std::filesystem, which is formally implemented in C++17. I'm sorry that we have not tested with this OS before. Still, we find some solutions that might work for you. [askubuntu.com](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1256440/how-to-get-libstdc-with-c17-filesystem-headers-on-ubuntu-18-bionic) says there might be two possible solutions:
1. move from `<filesystem>` to `<experimental/filesystem>`
2. install gcc-9 and g++-9, then create soft links to let cmake use them.

Thank you very much for your work. I have successfully run the code on Ubuntu 18.04. The error was resolved using the following method:
1.
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-9 g++-9
```
and add to CMakeLists:
```
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
link_libraries(stdc++fs)
```
